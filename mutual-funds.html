    <h1>What are Mutual Funds?</h1>
    <p>
      Mutual Funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors 
      and invest it in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. 
      They are managed by professional fund managers and are suitable for both beginners 
      and experienced investors who want diversification and professional management.
