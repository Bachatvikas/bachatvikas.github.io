Mutual Funds are one of the most popular investment choices in India. They pool money from multiple investors and invest it in stocks, bonds, or a mix of both.  

### âœ… Why Invest in Mutual Funds?

- **Professional Management**: Managed by expert fund managers.  
- **Flexibility**: Choose from equity, debt, hybrid, or sector funds.
