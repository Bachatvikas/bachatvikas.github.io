  <h1>Why Financial Literacy Matters More Than Income</h1>

  <p>
    Many people believe earning more money will solve financial problems.
    In reality, financial literacy plays a much bigger role.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Financial Literacy?</h2>
  <p>
    Financial literacy means understanding how money works —
    budgeting, saving, investing, and managing risk.
  </p>

  <h2>High Income Without Knowledge</h2>
  <p>
    People with high income but poor money habits often struggle with
    debt, stress, and financial instability.
  </p>

  <h2>Low Income With Literacy</h2>
  <p>
    A person with modest income but good financial discipline can
    build stability, confidence, and long-term security.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Literacy Wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Better decision making</li>
    <li>Lower financial stress</li>
    <li>More control over the future</li>
  </ul>
