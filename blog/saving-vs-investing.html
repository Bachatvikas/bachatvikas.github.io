  <h1>Saving vs Investing: What’s the Real Difference?</h1>

  <p>
    Many people use saving and investing interchangeably, but they serve
    very different purposes in personal finance.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Saving?</h2>
  <p>
    Saving means keeping money aside in a safe place such as a bank account
    for short-term needs or emergencies.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Investing?</h2>
  <p>
    Investing means putting money into assets like mutual funds or stocks
    with the goal of growing wealth over the long term.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Differences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Saving is low risk, investing involves market risk</li>
    <li>Saving protects money, investing helps money grow</li>
    <li>Saving is short-term focused, investing is long-term focused</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
  <p>
    Both are important. Saving helps you stay secure, while investing
    helps you beat inflation and build wealth.
