  <h1>What Is SIP and How It Works for Long-Term Wealth</h1>

  <p>
    SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly
    ways to start investing. It allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly
    instead of investing a large sum at once.
  </p>

  <h2>What is SIP?</h2>
  <p>
    SIP is a method of investing in mutual funds where you invest a fixed amount
    at regular intervals such as monthly or quarterly.
  </p>

  <h2>How SIP Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You choose an amount (for example ₹1,000 per month)</li>
    <li>The amount is invested automatically</li>
    <li>You buy more units when markets are low and fewer when markets are high</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why SIP Is Powerful</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Encourages financial discipline</li>
    <li>Reduces market timing risk</li>
    <li>Helps in long-term wealth creation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Consider SIP?</h2>
  <p>
    SIPs are suitable for beginners, salaried individuals, and anyone who wants
    to build wealth gradually without stress.
